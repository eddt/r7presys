=== Relative Menu Item ===

Create custom menu items with links relative to the wordpress root url.



== Description ==

Create custom menu items with links relative to the root url of the current wordpress installation.

Simply add a custom link as normal with the url prefixed by %ROOT%. e.g. to get http://mydomain.com/wp/myCustomPage if your wordpress lives at http://mydomain.com/wp then you just write %ROOT%/myCustomPage for your link url.

== Important Notes ==

Not tested with multisite installations.


== Installation ==

Check out the [official installation guide](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins). It's totally more awesome than anything I'd be bothered to write here. Plus, wordpress codex is your friend. (Mostly).
